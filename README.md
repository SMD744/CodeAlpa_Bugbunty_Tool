Automated bug bounty scanner for web apps. Scans for XSS, SQLi, logic flaws, misconfigurations, and more.

# üõ°Ô∏è Bug Bounty Automation Tool

A powerful, easy-to-use Python-based **bug bounty scanner** designed to help identify common web vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and **logic flaws**.

Developed during my **CodeAlpha Internship**, this tool provides both **TXT** and **HTML** reporting, making it ideal for pentesters, bug bounty hunters, and developers.

### üß† How It Works

When you run the tool, it performs a series of automated tests to check the security of a website. Here‚Äôs what each step does and why it‚Äôs important:

1. **Host Availability Check**
   The tool first tries to connect to the website to see if it‚Äôs online and reachable. If the site is down or the address is incorrect, the scan stops here since no further checks can be done.

2. **Header Security Analysis**
   Websites send security headers as part of their HTTP response. These headers help protect users against attacks like clickjacking or content injection. The tool checks if important headers like `Content-Security-Policy` or `Strict-Transport-Security` are missing, which might indicate weaker security.

3. **Detection of Sensitive/Admin Paths**
   Many websites have special URLs for logging in or administration (like `/admin`, `/login`). These paths can sometimes be exposed accidentally. The tool scans common sensitive paths to see if they exist and are accessible, which might allow unauthorized access.

4. **Scanning for Vulnerabilities:**
   The tool tries to find common security flaws by sending specific test requests:

   * **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Attempts to manipulate database queries by injecting special characters or commands through URL parameters.
   * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Checks if the website improperly displays user input that could allow attackers to run malicious scripts.
   * **Open Redirects:** Tests if the site redirects users to untrusted external websites, which attackers can exploit in phishing attacks.

5. **CORS Configuration Validation**
   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) controls how resources on a website can be requested from other domains. The tool checks if the site‚Äôs CORS settings are too open, which can lead to unauthorized data access from malicious sites.

6. **SSL Certificate Info (for HTTPS Sites)**
   If the website uses HTTPS, the tool retrieves details about its SSL certificate, like who issued it and when it expires. This helps verify if the site‚Äôs encrypted connection is properly configured and trustworthy.

7. **Report Generation (TXT / HTML)**
   After all tests complete, the tool compiles the findings into a detailed report. You can choose between a simple text file or a formatted HTML report that‚Äôs easier to read and share.

### üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `requests` package (`pip install requests`)

---

### üêç Setup with a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Using a virtual environment helps keep your project dependencies isolated and avoids conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

#### 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv  # create virtual environment named 'venv'
source venv/bin/activate  # activate the virtual environment
pip install requests  # install required package
```

#### 2. Run the bug bounty tool

```bash
python Bugbunty.py testphp.vulnweb.com
```

Replace `testphp.vulnweb.com` with your target URL.

To generate an HTML report instead of plain text:

```bash
python Bugbunty.py testphp.vulnweb.com --report html
```

---

### üìÅ Example Output

The tool generates a file like:
`bugbounty_report_testphp.vulnweb.com_20250808_153045.html`

Which includes:

* Missing security headers
* Exposed admin/login pages
* Potential vulnerabilities with affected URLs
* SSL issuer & expiration

---

üìå Sample Scan Command

```bash
python Bugbunty.py testphp.vulnweb.com --report html
firefox bugbounty_report_testphp.vulnweb.com_20250808_153045.html  # Open report in Firefox
```
